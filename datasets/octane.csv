Smooth writing pens at a great price.,"I had run out of pens and due to the lockdown, the stationary shops were closed. I am used to writing with ball pens, but nevertheless decided to buy these. These pens are really good. They are light and comfortable to write with. Also they write smoothly and unlike most ball pens they do not stop writing half way. They write properly till the end of the refill. Only downside is you cannot write very fast with it. The price also is good. Please go ahead and buy them if you are in need of good pens.",5.0 out of 5 stars

A nice looking colorful set of blue gel pens,I really love octane classmate gel pens they are cost effective colorful and the best part of it is its ink which is much deep blue compare to other gel pens that available in the market right now. It's gives a feeling of Add gel which I used when I was in my school. Added to this it comes in a nice neon colors and it also got a rubber grip which helps to have a good hold while writing. Overall it's a value for money and I am really happy that Amazon make this product eligible for prime customer.

Too much ink leakage,Better to go with some other gel pen as the gel spread too much making your hands untidy. Ink also appears on the other side of the page.,1.0 out of 5 stars
These are not neon colored pens...only body is neon,"Its quite obvious the seller has written a factually incorrect description to grab attention. No where in the description is it mentioned that it writes in blue ink. Only the body is neon color, they all write in blue ink. The first statement itself is a lie..and that too purposely written so. Because by the time you buy it, the amount is too less for you to return it. Pls give this guy a very low rating for all the parameters. Whenever anyone posts a purposely wrong description, pls give lowest rating",1.0 out of 5 stars

I bought regular blue gel pens,"I only bought this because i thought the ink would be neon colour too. But these are regular blue gel pens. All of them. The moment i wrote my first letter, i was utterly disappointed. May be i was negligent of seeing the description or the description was not so clear. I mean i am okay to use the pens anyway but its just not what i thought i was buying. I trust the brand though. I bought it, so i bought it!",4.0 out of 5 stars
