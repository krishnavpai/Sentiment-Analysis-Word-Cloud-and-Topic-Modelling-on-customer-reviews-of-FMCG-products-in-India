It contains a gentle cleansing agent that lathers up amazingly and it smells great as well,"I live in north india where the climate is mostly humid and sweat a lot and sweaty scalp means hair fall . My hairs are very dry and frizzy and at times unmanageable but thanks to Head & Shoulder smooth & silky anti dandruff shampoo. Its tri action formula cleanses , nourishes and protects.

It contains a gentle cleansing agent that lathers up amazingly and it smells great as well. And of course it's gentle enough to use everyday even on chemical treated hair.. for the Protection aspects of formula they use micro zinc particles called Zinc pyrithione (ZPT) best known for its use in treating dandruff and seborrhoeic dermatitis.

It does what it says.
Leaves ur hair 10 times stronger ..

Best anti dandruff shampoo,"It’s been a lot of years now that I have been using Head & Shoulders.
The shampoo has always been successful in providing nourishment to my hair and giving them a smooth shine. It keeps my scalp dandruff free and helps in conditioning as well.
After using this shampoo it gets really easy for me to tame the frizzy hair. It nourishes and protect me the scalp and thus leaves it dandruff free.
Head & Shoulders smooth and silky is my favourite variant because of its pleasant smell and formula.
I would recommend this to anybody looking for shampoo which is anti dandruff and at the same time leaves hair smooth and silky.",5.0 out of 5 stars

It has helped reduce my dandruff problem and I like its fragrance as well. In the summers, the menthol gives a cooling effect. The price is affordable and the shampoo is very impressive. For best results, do buy the conditioner, too.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Satisfied: Best for summers,H&S is a household brand name & rightly so. The products are worthwhile. It’s summer time now and our hair needs shampooing all the more!! I ordered this H&S “smooth & silky” shampoo of 1 litre. Quite a wise choice as 1.) my hair feels fresh. 2.) It’s a huge bottle and will work for the entire summer season. It also works on my dandruff which is the best part. There’ll be nothing else that I need! Satisfied.,4.0 out of 5 stars

The Shampoo I trust!,"The best thing about Head & Shoulders (smooth &silky) Shampoo is, it doesn't make my hair rough like other anti-dandruff shampoos. Two years back, I was frantically searching for a shampoo that can solve my dandruff problem without damaging my hair. After using a couple of other brands, I finally settled with H&S.  It gently takes care of the hair and scalp making it dandruff-free. It also leaves my hair soft and manageable. Value for money as the dispenser allows you to use just the right amount you need. Last but not the least, its fine fragrance is just my favourite.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Value For Money,"Actually, I bought the shampoo because it seemed good value for money. I mean Rs 539 for 1L is really affordable, it seemed like a steal deal. And I am happy I took this risk because the shampoo is worth it. It lives up to its promise of smooth and silky. As I colour my hair, it tends to break and become frizzy. So, this shampoo helps. Albeit, I do suggest that people use it in small quantities and do two washes rather than taking a lot and trying to get results in one wash.",5.0 out of 5 stars
