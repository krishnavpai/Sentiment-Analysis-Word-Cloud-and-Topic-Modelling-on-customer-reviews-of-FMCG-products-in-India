Cultural food of mountain.,"Utilize your 5 minutes to know about your Maggi.

We cannot ignore the fact that Maggi noodles and other processed foods are replacing everyday foods like rice, pulses and vegetables. This is quite common among teenagers, engineers and children.

Now let us understand few points related to Maggi.

1. Maggi is primarily made from Maida and regular consumption can lead to obesity and other digestive disorders.

2. It is a highly processed product with low nutritional value; it is high in carbohydrates, salt and other food additives, but low in important elements such as fibre, vitamins and minerals.

3. It contains a number of substances that are harmful to our metabolic system, which I have outlined in chemical components.

4. Noodles contain most of the salt and excessive salt consumption is associated with hypertension, cardiovascular disease and kidney damage.

5. Some of the thickeners and acidity regulators in Maggi are easily absorbed by the body and accumulate in the heart, liver and kidneys. As a result, these chemicals damage the immune system.

6. Maggi noodles contain high concentration of flavor enhancer which can cause health problems like allergies.

7. Certain chemicals in instant noodles have been linked to cancer.

Chemical component:

1. Thickeners (412): Guar gum In July 2007, the European Commission issued a warning to its member states after high levels of dioxins were found in guar gum. The source was guar gum from India contaminated with pentachlorophenol, a pesticide. Dioxins damage the human immune system and can cause a number of diseases including cancer. Most manufacturers do not test for guar gum contamination and do not have the equipment to test for it.

2. Acidity Regulator (501 (I)): Used as an acidity regulator (which regulates the acidity or alkalinity of foods) and a buffering agent (which maintains the acidity of foods) in many foods such as fine bakery products. beverages, confectionery, pudding, cocoa powder, in alcoholic beverages such as mead and wine. May cause toxicity if swallowed or inhaled. In the form of supplements, you should not overdo it, which is dangerous.

3. Acidity regulator (500 (ii)): Widely used to control the pH of food products. It is also used as a leavening agent, producing carbon dioxide to increase baking.

4. Humectant (451(I)): This is a food additive used in food products to maintain moisture in food.

5. Acidity regulator (330): Used for flavoring and does not cause health problems.

6. Thickener (508): The gelling agent E508 is found in many types of bulk foods because it prevents clumping during long-term storage. Excessive consumption of the gelling agent E508 is toxic and harmful to health. Some people may develop upper gastrointestinal bleeding after using gelling agent E508.

7. Flavor enhancer (635): Mainly used in low sodium/salt foods, should be avoided by asthmatics.

8. Color (150d): Used for coloring (caramel color) and can cause cancer.

I used to eat Maggi with my friends when I was in college and I still eat it whenever I go to the mountains. In my opinion, everything in excess is bad. Although it is less dangerous than smoke and alcohol, it should not be consumed. I know we won't stop, so let's understand how to mitigate its negative consequences:

1. As it contains wax, sodium and other ingredients, all you have to do is boil it in water for some time, then remove the crappy water and cook Maggi with spices and some.

2. Eat only once a week.

3. Maggi or any other noodles contain wax, hence they are slippery and shiny. Consuming Maggi once takes at least two days to completely remove its wax and harmful effects from your body.

4. Always drink a cup of hot water or something to help you digest that wonderful waste.

5. If you can't do it, drink a glass of warm water as soon as you wake up the next morning.

I would like to emphasize that we are responsible for our own health. ""Just two minutes, Maggi ready to serve,"" but these two minutes have a negative impact on our growth. We pay a lot more for those two minutes if we allow Maggi to disrupt our metabolism. Instead of Maggi, try traditional snacks like upma, poha, idlis, sandwiches and so on which are more nutritious and easier to cook. Now that you know, try to remember these principles the next time you are hungry and want to eat some Maggi. It's entirely up to you what well-cooked food you choose to go with these unhealthy two-minute noodles.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"Good, but used to be much better.","I've been consuming Maggi since my childhood, and now I'm 46. In recent times, the quality is not as consistent as it used to be. It keeps varying with each batch. Sometimes it's too dry, sometimes it's too brittle, sometimes it looks pale and dangerous to consume. But so far nothing bad happened after eating it. The flavour also is not quite what it used to be. Of course, I still remain loyal to the brand, unless something real bad happens.",4.0 out of 5 stars

A great alternative to buying Maggi at grocery store during the current pandemic,"There is no point discussing the taste because well , Maggi is Maggi .
The was it is packaged is that the 12 individual packets are inside an outer transparent packet with Maggi branding , suggesting that it is packaged this way at the factory , so you only have the wash the outet packaging and not the indiviual packets when it arrives at your doorstep instead of the individual packet reducing the hastle during this pandemic .
If you can get it at a off , it is an pretty decent deal .",5.0 out of 5 stars

Looks Suspicious Tastes Weird,"To be honest this particular maggie 2 mins noodles looks suspicious & tastes weired. Why so?
Suspicious: The 2 mins instant noodles is like no other maggie noodles i are before. After 10 mins of soaking in hot water is still not soft enough. It stays skinny stiff & not properly soaked.
Weired: It tastes different. Not like normal maggie I've eaten before, which were bought from BB/Market. It doesn't taste bad but not good either. The typical maggie flavour is missing.
Product has a manufacturing date of May, 2020 & 9 months to go till expiry.

the ones i bought from local market is fine and taste good. but this time this maggi packet has less masala and tastes so bland because of this.
previous purchase were fine. but this time they got me. regretting the purchase. its 10% cheap, but you get substandard batch of maggi ,, if not now, then in future purchase. someday they will loot you.

noodle cake is fine. but only masala is less. because of which the flavor doesnt come like it normally does",1.0 out of 5 stars

Why Amazon dispatched the open product when packet was open at the first place., The packet received in opened condition. 2 small packets out of 12 (in 1 out of 4) were opened and noodle lying were coming out. (As seen in pics). This was for sure visible and known fact before dispatch. Needs refund for two packs. Disappointed with such things happening at AMAZON. Why Amazon dispatched the open product when packet was open at the first place. Even if 2 small pkts were open the Amazon should not have charged. Seeks refund for 2packets (Rs.12x2).

Maggie cooked is giving foul smell and have bitter taste,"Hi Amazon team

I had bought 2*10Packets Maggie from you and it turns out 3packets which I have used today was having some issues.

After it was cooked foul smell is coming from them. My kids did vomit after having them. Taste is also bitter.
I am afraid it looks like food poisoning.

One of the packet of 10 packet is still not opened. I want you to return them. Looks like all packets have same issue.",1.0 out of 5 stars
